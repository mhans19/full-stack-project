## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
> The purpose of this project is to collaboratively develop an application that meets a real-world need. The project should include a quality user story
and acceptance criteria to aid development.The group should utilize the full-stack web development skills learned thus far in the Bootcamp course. The group is expected to present the project and convince an audience that it serves a purpose. Full project and presentation requirements are detailed below.  

> This project aims to bridge the gap for several common developer problems. First, developers and programmers often charge clients based on programming hours and may need an efficient way to track the amount of time they contribute to various projects. Developers also may want to build their portfolios in a way that highlights the amount of time they have contributed to different coding languages. Finally, collaborating teams often want to track how long projects take to complete. This project is Timed-Out, a full-stack web application that provides an interface for users to track their contributions on established projects.

- [x] Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- [x] Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
- [x] Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- [x] Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- [x] Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- [x] Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
- [x] Have a polished UI.
- [x] Be responsive.
- [x] Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- [x] Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
